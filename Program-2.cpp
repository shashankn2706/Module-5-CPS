//In the given code snippet to calculate the area of rectangle, some essential statements are missing. Complete the following C++ code which computes the area of a rectangle.

//Initially to calculate the area of rectangle we require length and breadth. Read the values with the help of standard input.
//Perform the operation to compute the area of rectangle.
//Finally, display the result on the standard output.


//Expected input & output:
//Enter the length of rectangle 4
//Enter the breadth of rectangle 8
//Area of rectangle 32

#include <iostream>
void main() {
 int ; //DECLARE SUITABLE VARIABLES
 cout << "\nEnter the Length of Rectangle : ";
 cin>>;  //complete the statement
 cout << "\nEnter the Breadth of Rectangle : ";
 cin>>; //complete the statement

   //Fill the suitable executable statement which computes area of rectangle

   cout << "\nArea of Rectangle: " << ; //complete the statement
}
