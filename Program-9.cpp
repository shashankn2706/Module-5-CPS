//Design and develop a C++ program to claculate the area of triangle

//In this program, the user enters the value of base and height with the help of standard input. 
//The Output for this program is the area of the triangle that will be displayed on the standard output.
//The formula to find area of triangle is 0.5*b*h

//Expected input and output
//Input: Enter the value of base and height: 10 2
//Output: The area of triangle is: 10
